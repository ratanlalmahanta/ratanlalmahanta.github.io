    <section id="about">
        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m <strong>Ratanlal Mahanta</strong>, a dedicated researcher and lead scientist specializing in <strong>Computational Finance</strong> and <strong>AI-Driven Quantitative Research</strong>. With over 12 years of experience, I focus on <strong>risk management</strong>, <strong>advanced financial modeling</strong>, and <strong>innovative AI applications</strong> in finance.</p>

        <p>Currently, I work on pioneering projects that integrate <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>stochastic modeling</strong>, and <strong>scenario simulations</strong> to push the boundaries of finance. My expertise spans various fields, including <strong>option pricing models</strong>, <strong>credit valuation adjustments (CVA)</strong>, <strong>climate risk</strong> in finance, and <strong>tail risk hedging</strong> through scenario simulations. I have an extensive background in <strong>Bayesian machine learning</strong>, <strong>quantitative trading strategies</strong>, and <strong>dynamic hedging</strong>.</p>

        <p>I hold a Masters in Computational Finance and have over <strong>330 citations</strong> with an <strong>h-index of 10</strong>. My work is recognized in global conferences, including <strong>IRMC 2024</strong>, <strong>IMRC Milan</strong>, and the <strong>Odisha AI Conference 2024</strong>. My contributions emphasize both innovation and practical applications in areas like model validation, market risk review, and green finance.</p>

        <p>With a strong foundation in the startup culture, I bring agility, technical depth, and a hands-on approach to my work. Here, I aim to share insights into my projects, from <strong>quantitative strategies</strong> to <strong>green finance initiatives</strong>, as well as explore how <strong>AI is reshaping financial markets</strong>.</p>
