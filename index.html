        <p>With 12 years of experience in computational finance and AI, I lead with a hands-on approach to developing and deploying advanced quantitative models. My work integrates machine learning, stochastic processes, and complex risk management frameworks to address critical challenges in finance. As a lead scientist and consultant, my focus extends across AI-driven financial markets, model validation, credit rating, and dynamic hedging, aiming to create robust, actionable insights that empower data-driven decision-making.</p>

        <p>I specialize in the calibration and application of models such as the Heston model, Hull-White interest rate models, and the Black-Karasinski model, tailoring them to meet the precise demands of risk management and market risk. Additionally, I have an active role in cutting-edge research on climate risk and green finance, contributing to the development of sustainable financial products and policies that support environmental transitions.</p>

        <p>My recent projects include creating a comprehensive framework for the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), simulating scenarios for tail risk hedging, and utilizing Bayesian methods to enhance the predictive power of financial models. These projects combine rigorous mathematical formulations, documentation, and AGI integration to ensure precision and scalability. I thrive in environments that prioritize innovation and technical excellence, blending startup agility with deep research rigor.</p>

        <p>Explore my projects, publications, and specialized insights to see how quantitative finance and AI are converging to drive the future of finance, from algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading systems to advanced portfolio optimization and beyond. Together, we can unlock new potentials in finance through intelligent, data-driven strategies that push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.</p>
