        <h2>Research & Development Projects</h2>
        
        <div class="project">
            <h3>AI-Driven Financial Markets</h3>
            <p>Focused on integrating advanced AI methodologies to enhance financial market predictions, risk management, and decision-making. This includes building quantitative models that leverage machine learning for real-time analysis and scenario simulations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>QuantEquity Selection Model</h3>
            <p>Developed a data-driven equity selection model, employing machine learning algorithms and risk management strategies. The model is designed for dynamic sector-wise stock selection using an ML approach for optimal portfolio construction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Heston Model Calibration for Volatility</h3>
            <p>Worked on calibrating the Heston model to fit market volatility quotes, focusing on achieving precise calibration for one-year maturity options. The project compares various model parameters to ensure alignment with real-world data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) Computation</h3>
            <p>Developed a robust method for calculating Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA), incorporating Monte Carlo simulations and quantitative techniques to manage counterparty risk in credit derivatives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Hull-White Short-Rate Model Calibration</h3>
            <p>Explored interest rate modeling by calibrating the Hull-White model with a focus on parameters 'a' and 'sigma'. This project integrates QuantLib and Monte Carlo simulations to address credit risk modeling through real-world case studies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) Implementation</h3>
            <p>Implemented the FRTB Standard Approach with applications to FX and interest rate asset classes. This involved complex mathematical derivations and modeling techniques, aimed at meeting regulatory requirements and mitigating market risks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Green Finance & Climate Risk Modeling</h3>
            <p>Part of a Special Issue paper submission focused on novel mathematical and statistical approaches to address climate risk and promote sustainable finance. Research integrates AI-based methods to optimize policies and financial products for environmental transition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Quantitative Trading Strategies</h3>
